# Some useful tools for Python [in context of Data Science]

Here I gather functions that I need.

Hope one time it will have a documentation published, but not for now )

## Installation

It's already published on PyPI, so simply

`pip install somepytools`

## Reference

Modules inclues:

- extended typing module
- common read-write operations for configs
- utils to work with filesystem
- functions to handle videos in opencv
- torch utilities (infer and count parameters)
- even more (e.g. wrapper to convert strings inputs to `pathlib`)

For now it's better to go through the files and look at contents
